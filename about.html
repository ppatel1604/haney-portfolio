      <h2>Meet Haney Parmar</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Haney Parmar. I am an artist and educator with a passion for visual storytelling, creativity and community-driven art. With experience spanning art education, large-scale mural projects m and freelance work. 
        I specialize in acrylic painting, traditional drawing, mandala art, and visual design.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey in art education includes working with schools, hobby centers, and private tutoring, where I have nurtured young minds helping them develop artistic skills and creative confidence. I have also contributed to public art projects
        with Chitranagari Group in Rajkot, Gujarat, India, bringing lift to urban spaces through large-scale wall paintings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether on canvas or city walls, my goal is to create art that inspires, connects, and leaves a lasting impact.
